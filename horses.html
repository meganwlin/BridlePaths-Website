              <u><b>Admiral</b></u> is the gentle giant of the Bridle Paths herd. A <b>Percheron-Thoroughbred</b> cross standing at least 17.2 hands high, our herd boss boasts a quiet and kind temperament and tremendous athleticism. He carries riders
              with ease and kindness in mounted sessions, and he lends his sensitivity and intuition to the psychotherapy arena as well. <br><br><i>We thank Admiral's owner, <b>Michael Hasz</b>, for free leasing this incredible horse to the program.</i></td>

              <u><b>Lucy</b></u> is a <b>Dutch Warmblood/Thoroughbred</b> mare from the famed Art Deco line. Lucy's flashy good looks and engaging personality have endeared her to many of our psychotherapy clients. Lucy continues her dressage education
              at Bridle Paths, and our more advanced riding students benefit greatly from her training. <br><br><i>Many thanks to <b>Sally O'Dwyer</b> of McLean, Virginia for donating this sweet mare to the program.</i></td>

              <b><u>Sunup</u></b> is a 2003 <b>Quarter Horse Gelding</b> standing 15.1 hands high. Sunup has had training in both hunters and dressage, and he offers great learning opportunities to our more independent riders. His quirky and inquisitive
              personality (and his close relationship with Admiral!) brings great insights in psychotherapy sessions. <br><br><i>Sunup is free leased to Bridle Paths by the <b>Fallon family</b>.</i></td>

              <b><u>Phillip</b></u> is an 18 year old <b>Dutch Warmblood Gelding</b> standing 16.2 hands high. He was imported from the Netherlands as a young horse, and has the passport to prove it! Phillip has worked in many disciplines, including hunters
              and dressage, and he boasted good ribbons at Dressage at Devon in his younger days. At Bridle Paths, Phillipâ€™s kind, gentle demeanor has made him a fast favorite among clients and volunteers alike. He relishes treats, and shows his appreciation
              with his trademark sticking out his tongue, reminiscent of Michael Jordan!<br><br><i>Phillip has been owned and loved for many years by <b>Dr. Larry Kupperberg</b>, who has opted to free lease this lovely horse to Bridle Paths.</i></td>

              <u><b>Pumpkin</b></u> is a teenage <b>Welsh/Thoroughbred</b> cross pony standing about 14 hands high. He comes to us from Connecticut, where he logged lots of miles in the hunter show arena. Pumpkin's extensive training helps us to teach
              the subtleties of seat, leg, and rein aids to our students. His sensitivity is a significant asset in the psychotherapy arena, as clients learn to read and convey nonverbal cues in relationship with horses.</td>

              experience in 4-H, showmanship, and Western disciplines, and he is free leased to the program by board member Alison Umberger. When he's not helping our students to learn about riding and horsemanship, Ty can be found enjoying turnout with

              people, and can be quite a clown seeking attention in the barn!<br><br><i>Elmo is generously free leased to the program by <b>Erika Andrews</b> of Syria, Virginia.</i> </td>

              days. Chance's show ring experience renders him unflappable and focused in the therapeutic riding arena. Standing 16.2 hands high, he is an appropriate mount for teenagers and adults alike. Chance is enjoying learning the ropes of the psychotherapy
              arena, where his mischievous personality really shines through.<br><br><i>Chance is free leased to the program by the <b>Fallon family.</b></i></td>
